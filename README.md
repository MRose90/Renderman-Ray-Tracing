# Renderman-Ray-Tracing

The deer polygons were given to me, so this project was all about ray tracing. 
Instead of doing a simple mirror, the two disks use the ray tracing and adjust their colors based on teh returned value.
The bottom disk subtracts the color that it found ray tracing from white.
The back disk subtracts the color it was suppose to be from the color it found.
These two disks also trace off eachother as can be seen close to where they touch.
